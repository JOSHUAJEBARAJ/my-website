## Introduction

Hello Friends ðŸ‘‹  ,hope everyone doing good .In this blog I am going to share how we can get started with the GCP

## Outcomes

By the end of the article you will be able to create the project and setting up the billing alerts in the Google Cloud

## Pre-requisite

- Valid Gmail ID
- Valid credit card (Don't worry you wont be charged)

## Creating the Google Cloud Account

Go to the [Google-cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) page and create the google cloud account  if you don't have google cloud account already, On signing up you will get **300 USD** as the sign up bonus for one year which will be more than enough for learning and Google also gives some of the resources free forever you can read more about that [here](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier)

## Creating the Project

Every GCP resource can be created only within the project. To create the new project click the drop down menu in the left corner

Click in the **NEW PROJECT** option ,enter the name of the project and click **Ok **

> Note we do have certain limitation on  number of projects that we can create under the free tier Keep this in mind while creating the project

## Setting up the billing alerts

While learning the GCP we want to make sure that we don't  accidentally ended up using more resources than the free tire ,In order to prevent the accidental cost we can setup the billing alert ,this will be also useful when we work in the organization 

 Click  the Billing Option in the left corner and select the default billing account

Click the Budget & alerts option and click create Budget

On the Next page enter the Name of the alerts we have to also set the following options

Projects - We can select either all projects or a particular project

Services - We can select either all services or particular services like compute , bucket

On the next page we will enter the amount for our example I have entered 1000rs

![Getting%20Started%20with%20GCP%2027f6b994f2024d819644ced25862b932/Screenshot_2021-03-02_at_12.34.52_PM.png](Getting%20Started%20with%20GCP%2027f6b994f2024d819644ced25862b932/Screenshot_2021-03-02_at_12.34.52_PM.png)

On the Next Page enter the threshold limits GCP by default creates 3 threshold limit we can either add or remove the threshold

Click **finish** once you have done .On successful creation you will see the new billing alert that we have created

## Introduction

Hello Friends ðŸ‘‹  ,hope everyone doing well .In this blog I am going to share how we can use **OS-Login** to secure the GCP Compute Instance access

## Outcomes

By the end of the article you will be able to get to know  use OS-login feature in the  **Google Cloud SDK** to make Secure

## Pre-requisite

- Computer with admin rights 
- GCP account

## Why OS login

Imagine some developer in your organization want to get the SSH access to the Compute Engine for debugging or for some testing purpose.You can do the following 
- Give Instance or Compute Engine admin access But the problem with this developer will also able to create delete stop instances this doesn't follow the principle of the least privelage
- Add the SSH-Keys to the instance  But there is no way to keep tracking and monitoring those keys in the large organization
  
In order to solve those problems GCP has introduced the **OS-Login** which allows the user only ssh into the instance

## OS Login advantage

- OS Login access are based on the IAM So if you decide the developer no longer need to access those resource want they can simply remove the role associated with the IAM

- OS login allow the user to give sudo permission or allow to login without the Sudo Permission

## How to Enable os Login

Enabling the OS login is the two step process

### Create the IAM user

Create the Iam user with the below two role


Go to the IAM Page in the GCP and Click **ADD**

> Image -1

Enter the **email-id** of the user you want to give access

> Image-2

Give the user below two permission

```
1. Service account User
2. Compute OS Login
```

> If you want to give access to give sudo access give Compute OS admin access

Click **save**

### Creating the Instance with the Metadata

Now we have to add the metadata to the instance to enable the OS login We have two choices

- Adding the metadata  project wide .This will enable the OS login in the all instance 
- Adding the metadata at the  instance level

For the sake of the article we are going to add metadata at instance level

Now go to the Compute Engine Console

> If you are creating the instance using the GUI click the down arrow symbol this will extend the additional options


> Image 
Enter the below value in the **Metadata** section

```
oslogin TRUE
```

> Image

Click **create**


Now I am switching  to the Developer account  and try to ssh into the instance 


You could see we are successfully able to ssh into the instance 

Now I am trying to delete the instance 

> Image

You could see I am getting permission denied

We have succesfully achieved the Least privelage

Imagine you longer want give access to the developer you could simply remove the previously assigned role 

Now I am trying to ssh into the instance after role removal

> image

You could see permission denied eventhough I was able to login into the instance previously

This is how we can use OS-login to Secure Compute Engine access
