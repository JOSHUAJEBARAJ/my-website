## Introduction

Hello Friends ðŸ‘‹  ,hope everyone doing good .In this blog I am going to share how we can get started with the GCP

## Outcomes

By the end of the article you will be able to create the project and setting up the billing alerts in the Google Cloud

## Pre-requisite

- Valid Gmail ID
- Valid credit card (Don't worry you wont be charged)

## Creating the Google Cloud Account

Go to the [Google-cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) page and create the google cloud account  if you don't have google cloud account already, On signing up you will get **300 USD** as the sign up bonus for one year which will be more than enough for learning and Google also gives some of the resources free forever you can read more about that [here](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier)

## Creating the Project

Every GCP resource can be created only within the project. To create the new project click the drop down menu in the left corner

## Setting up the billing alerts

While learning the GCP we want to make sure that we don't  accidentally ended up using more resources than the free tire ,In order to prevent the accidental cost we can setup the billing alert ,this will be also useful when we work in the organization 

 Click  the Billing Option in the left corner and select the default billing account
