## Introduction 

Hello Friends in this blog I am going to share my course experience on the [DevSecOps Academy](https://app.devsecops-academy.com/) Last week I got a chance beta access to their courses So I took Secrets Management of your applications

## Course structure
The course was well structured. Initially, I thought It would be a long boring lecture but to be my surprise it was a mixture between videos and text . The instructor was able to explain the concept in a clear and concise manner. I was able to finish the complete the full course in the single sitting

## The Exam
After the course, there was a lab in which we have to finish in order to get the certificates. The best thing about the lab is they offer the lab in different programming languages like python ,java,.net.This is not a straight forward exercise you will have to read some documentation and do your homework so be prepared.So you can opt for the different languages After successfully completing the lab you will be getting the certificate when your lab was verified by the instructor

## What I liked in the course?
- Well structured
- Short and easy so I can complete the single course in a single day
- Additional references so I can learn more about the topics in-depth which are not covered in the lesson
- Local lab setup guide this helps me to set up and practice the lab at my local 
  
## What could be improved?
- There could be a complete curriculum like udacity,udemy courses for each course so the student can know beforehand exactly what they are going to learn
- There could be a mock lab where a student can practice the lab before the actual lab
